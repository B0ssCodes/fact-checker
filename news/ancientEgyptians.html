            <p class="newsText">Archaeologists in Egypt have uncovered a rare intact sarcophagus dating back over 2,500 years. But upon opening the ancient coffin, the research team found not a mummy, but a puzzling black liquid instead.</p>
            <p class="newsText">The stone sarcophagus was one of several found in an immense, unearthed burial shaft near the Egyptian city of Alexandria. While other coffins housed carefully wrapped mummies, this particular sarcophagus contained a mysterious inky pool of what is presumed to be ancient embalming fluid. Tests are underway to analyze the liquid which is the first of its kind ever found untouched by modern archaeologists.</p>
            <p class="newsText">The finding has captured the curiosity of Egyptian antiquities researchers. But it also highlights the fact that there is still much mystery and knowledge to be gained from the region's ancient past. This rare, accidental time capsule promises to reveal insights into ancient Egyptian burial rituals that have been lost for millennia. Scientists hope studying its contents in detail may fill gaps in our understanding of how pharaohs were laid to rest thousands of years ago.</p>
