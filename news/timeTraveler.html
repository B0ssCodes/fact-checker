            <p class="newsText">A strange man surfaced this week with an extraordinary claim - that he traveled back in time to our present year from over a century in the future. The individual, who identifies himself only as John, asserts he was sent to deliver an urgent message about catastrophic events destined to occur if society stays on its current path.</p>
            <p class="newsText">John appeared disoriented and wearing unusual clothing when he materialized at a shopping mall in Portland, Oregon. He immediately sought out authorities to describe his story of being a time traveler from the year 2148 and relay a dire warning for humanity. Naturally, skepticism remains high over John's far-fetched assertions.</p>
            <p class="newsText">Still, John continues sharing chilling details of the future he describes - including widespread technological dependence, environmental disaster, and the prediction that humans will rely almost entirely on machines in just over a century. John himself claims to be an android-human hybrid. While an elaborate hoax cannot be ruled out, his serious demeanor and intricate descriptions have captivated the curiosity of many eager to hear his full message.</p>
