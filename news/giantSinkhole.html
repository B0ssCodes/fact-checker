            <p class="newsText">Residents of a suburban neighborhood in Florida were shocked this week when a massive sinkhole suddenly formed, engulfing two homes and several backyards. The giant chasm stretched over 600 feet wide and 50 feet deep, appearing practically overnight.</p>
            <p class="newsText">Experts are urgently investigating what caused the huge sinkhole near Tampa to open so swiftly and with such power. Geologists are studying the ground composition and water table in the area for explanations. Meanwhile, the two homes lost completely in the sinkhole have been deemed unsalvageable, devastating their owners.</p>
            <p class="newsText">No causalities were reported, but the freak incident has neighbors on edge. Sinkholes are not uncommon in Florida, but rarely on such a devastating scale. As cleanup and examination of the area continues, officials are evacuating nearby houses deemed at risk. They assure residents that answers are being sought to explain how their quiet community became the site of such an anomalous disaster seemingly overnight.</p>
